# MyApp 📱🚀

**MyApp** is a repository developed as part of the JStack course studies, focusing on understanding and practicing the fundamentals of React Native, assuming you already have a solid base in React and JavaScript. The idea behind this project is to serve as a “study notebook”, where the most important code snippets, concepts, and examples were recorded for future reference.

## 📝 Key concepts studied

Throughout the course and in the implementations in this repository, several core React Native topics were explored, including:

- React Native architecture: **Bridge** and **Fabric**.  
- Differences between **React Native CLI** (used in this project) and **Expo** (Managed / Bare Workflow).  
- Basic UI components: **View**, **Text**, and **ScrollView**, along with their main properties and use cases.  
- Multi-platform support using the **Platform** API (OS detection, version, `select()`, constants, etc.).  
- Working with **StatusBar** and **SafeAreaView** to handle safe areas and responsive UI layouts.  
- Styling patterns in mobile development and differences compared to CSS on the web.  
- Touch and interaction components: **Button**, **TouchableOpacity**, **TouchableHighlight**, **Pressable**, and others — including touch event handling.  
- Data input: **TextInput** (including `multiline` as a textarea), **Switch**, and **KeyboardAvoidingView**.  
- List rendering with **FlatList** and **SectionList**, using props such as `keyExtractor`, `renderItem`, etc.  
- Additional UI utilities and components: **ActivityIndicator**, **Modal**, **Alert API**, **ActionSheetIOS**.  
- **Dark Mode** support using the **useColorScheme** hook.  
- Working with **images**: remote loading, `resizeMode`, `defaultSource` placeholders, loading events, background images, pixel density / PPI, `PixelRatio`, `Dimensions`, and when to use SVGs.  
- Android-specific components: **DrawerLayoutAndroid** and **InputAccessoryView**.  
- Configuring and using custom fonts in iOS and Android, as well as applicable concepts in Expo.  
- Best practices for HTTP requests and communication with external APIs (available in personal notes).  
- Considerations around application updates and versioning in React Native apps (also in personal notes).
